# Smart Healthcare System for Brain Tumor Detection and Classification Using Advanced Deep Learning Techniques

This repository contains the resources and code for the **Smart Healthcare System for Brain Tumor Detection and Classification Using Advanced Deep Learning Techniques** project. The project leverages an enhanced Faster R-CNN framework with a hybrid VGG-16 and ResNet architecture for detecting and classifying brain tumors from MRI images. This system is designed to assist healthcare professionals in making accurate and efficient diagnoses by automating the detection process.

## Project Overview

Brain tumor detection and classification is a critical task in medical imaging that requires precise analysis of MRI scans. This project aims to develop an AI-powered system that automatically detects and classifies three types of brain tumorsâ€”glioma, meningioma, and pituitary tumorsâ€”using advanced deep learning techniques.

The model is deployed as a web application called **NeuroScan AI**, where users can upload MRI images and receive real-time results on tumor detection and classification.

## Features

- **Automated Detection and Classification**: Detects and classifies brain tumors into glioma, meningioma, and pituitary tumors.
- **Web-based Interface**: Easy-to-use interface for uploading MRI images and receiving diagnostic results.
- **Real-time Results**: Provides real-time predictions of tumor type, along with confidence scores.
- **Visualization**: Displays bounding boxes around detected tumors on the uploaded MRI image.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project is from FigShare, available at [FigShare Brain Tumor Dataset](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/brain_tumor_dataset/1512427). This dataset contains MRI images of brain tumors, including glioma, meningioma, and pituitary tumors. The images and the annotations corresponding to the tumor regions were originally stored in MATLAB `.mat` file format. To simplify image processing for this project, we converted the `.mat` files to `.jpg` format using a custom MATLAB script.
### Conversion Process

The following MATLAB script was used to convert the `.mat` images to `.jpg` format. The MRI images are normalized, converted to `uint8`, and saved as `.jpg` files. This process ensures that the images are ready for use in common deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

### MATLAB to JPEG Conversion Script

```matlab
% Define the folder where the .mat files are located and the folder to save .jpg images
matFilesFolder = 'mat_files'; % Folder containing .mat files
outputImagesFolder = 'pics';  % Folder to save the converted .jpg images

% Check for the existence of the output image folder
if ~exist(outputImagesFolder, 'dir')
    mkdir(outputImagesFolder); % Create the folder if it doesn't exist
end

% Get a list of all .mat files in the folder
matFiles = dir(fullfile(matFilesFolder, '*.mat'));

for k = 1:length(matFiles)
    % Load each .mat file
    matFilePath = fullfile(matFilesFolder, matFiles(k).name);
    load(matFilePath); % Load the .mat file contents
    
    % Extract the image data from the loaded .mat file
    image_data = cjdata.image;
    
    % Convert the image to uint8 format if necessary
    if isa(image_data, 'int16')
        image_data_double = double(image_data);
        % Normalize the data to the range 0 to 255
        image_data_uint8 = uint8(255 * (image_data_double - min(image_data_double(:))) / ...
            (max(image_data_double(:)) - min(image_data_double(:))));
    else
        image_data_uint8 = image_data; % If already in a compatible format
    end
    
    % Save the image as a JPEG file with a numbered name
    imageFileName = sprintf('%d.jpg', k); % Name the image file using numbering
    imwrite(image_data_uint8, fullfile(outputImagesFolder, imageFileName)); % Save as .jpg
end

disp('Images have been successfully saved to the folder.');
```
### Annotations Extraction
In addition to the image conversion, the annotations related to the tumor regions were extracted from the `.mat` files and saved as `.txt` files. These annotations include the tumor type, bounding boxes. For detailed annotations extraction steps, you can refer to the data_preparation.ipynb notebook available in this repository.
