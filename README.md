## Project Overview

Brain tumor detection and classification is a critical task in medical imaging that requires precise analysis of MRI scans. This project aims to develop an AI-powered system that automatically detects and classifies three types of brain tumorsâ€”glioma, meningioma, and pituitary tumorsâ€”using advanced deep learning techniques.

The model is deployed as a web application called **NeuroScan AI**, where users can upload MRI images and receive real-time results on tumor detection and classification.

## Features

- **Automated Detection and Classification**: Detects and classifies brain tumors into glioma, meningioma, and pituitary tumors.
- **Web-based Interface**: Easy-to-use interface for uploading MRI images and receiving diagnostic results.
- **Real-time Results**: Provides real-time predictions of tumor type, along with confidence scores.
- **Visualization**: Displays bounding boxes around detected tumors on the uploaded MRI image.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project is from FigShare, available at [FigShare Brain Tumor Dataset](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/brain_tumor_dataset/1512427). This dataset contains MRI images of brain tumors, including glioma, meningioma, and pituitary tumors. The images and the annotations corresponding to the tumor regions were originally stored in MATLAB `.mat` file format. To simplify image processing for this project, we converted the `.mat` files to `.jpg` format using a custom MATLAB script.
### Conversion Process

The following MATLAB script was used to convert the `.mat` images to `.jpg` format. The MRI images are normalized, converted to `uint8`, and saved as `.jpg` files. This process ensures that the images are ready for use in common deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

### MATLAB to JPEG Conversion Script

```matlab
% Define the folder where the .mat files are located and the folder to save .jpg images
matFilesFolder = 'mat_files'; % Folder containing .mat files
outputImagesFolder = 'pics';  % Folder to save the converted .jpg images

% Check for the existence of the output image folder
if ~exist(outputImagesFolder, 'dir')
    mkdir(outputImagesFolder); % Create the folder if it doesn't exist
end

% Get a list of all .mat files in the folder
matFiles = dir(fullfile(matFilesFolder, '*.mat'));

for k = 1:length(matFiles)
    % Load each .mat file
    matFilePath = fullfile(matFilesFolder, matFiles(k).name);
    load(matFilePath); % Load the .mat file contents
    
    % Extract the image data from the loaded .mat file
    image_data = cjdata.image;
    
    % Convert the image to uint8 format if necessary
    if isa(image_data, 'int16')
        image_data_double = double(image_data);
        % Normalize the data to the range 0 to 255
        image_data_uint8 = uint8(255 * (image_data_double - min(image_data_double(:))) / ...
            (max(image_data_double(:)) - min(image_data_double(:))));
    else
        image_data_uint8 = image_data; % If already in a compatible format
    end
    
    % Save the image as a JPEG file with a numbered name
    imageFileName = sprintf('%d.jpg', k); % Name the image file using numbering
    imwrite(image_data_uint8, fullfile(outputImagesFolder, imageFileName)); % Save as .jpg
end

disp('Images have been successfully saved to the folder.');
```
### Annotations Extraction
In addition to the image conversion, the annotations related to the tumor regions were extracted from the `.mat` files and saved as `.txt` files. These annotations include the tumor type, bounding boxes. For detailed annotations extraction steps, you can refer to the `data_preparation.ipynb` notebook available in this repository.
