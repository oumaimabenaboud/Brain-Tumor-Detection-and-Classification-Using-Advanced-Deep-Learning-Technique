# Brain-Tumor-Detection-and-Classification-Using-Advanced-Deep-Learning-Technique
This project utilizes an enhanced Faster R-CNN deep learning model, integrated with a hybrid VGG-16 and ResNet backbone, to automatically detect and classify brain tumors from MRI images. The system is deployed as a web application, providing real-time diagnostic assistance for glioma, meningioma, and pituitary tumors.
